# ABOUT CLICHE

This application automatically generates Examination Matrix,Attendance sheets and Seating Plan.
It takes three input fles in .xlsx format.The three input files are :
* datesheet.xlsx
* student list .xlsx
* roomfile.xlsx

## INPUT FILES
* datesheet.xlsx contains the date,time ,exam name, subject code of the paper.
* sudent list.xlsx contains information about student for e.g.,their names,enrollnment number,semester etc.
* roomfile.xlsx contains information about the rows and coulmns in which the students are to be seated.

```
For example if a room named E2-101 have 5 rows  and 12 columns then the roomfile.xlsx will have E2-101 
in its 1st column ,5 in its 2nd and 6(half of 12 for some reason) in its 3rd column.
```
I am including all three files inside the Matrix_Gen folder.You can look at the format of these files.
